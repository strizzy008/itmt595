## Project Idea & Outline

We are the _Slayers_, and our idea is to create a modern real estate application that uses a modern UI to easily connect potential buyers/tenants with sellers/landlords and other roommates.

### Overall idea

The overall idea is to enable everyday users on the application to be able to rent and buy real estate of all sorts. _i.e. Apartments, Condos, Homes, Etc._

This particular real estate app will be focused on using a 'Tinder' swipe and match concept. Instead of 2 individual people matching however, it is the user (you) matching with a listing property that you **like,** essentially being able to swipe until you find your perfect new home with a more user friendly and holistic experience.

Filtering is going to be our focal point. Showcasing a concrete step by step process is going to differentiate us from other platforms. Furthermore, adding a **ROOMMATE** feature will help differentiate us even more. This can be under the RENT selection of which the user will choose.

```
E.G. MASTER ------------> SPECIFIC

RENT or BUY
    |            |
    |       Specific filters (Beds, baths, sqft, price range , etc.)
    |
Roommate (Y/N)?
    |
Specific filters
```

## Github Guidelines

For GitHub, we should all fork the team repository and set the primary repo as a remote repository. Any changes we make to our code should be pushed locally and then changes should be merged with a majority consent on GitHub. This should cut down on the amount of merge conflicts and allow us to all work faster without much worry of destroying the project accidentally, or accidentally uploading unnecessary files.
